    file, the relationship column value is always "ortholog".

    this file does not report relationships symmetrically.  instead,
    a primary organism/gene is identified for each ortholog, and is
    represented in the first two columns.  all other orthologous
    organisms/genes are represented in the last two columns.  thus,
    each record in the file represents a pair of orthologous genes.
    if there are n orthologous genes in a group, then there will be
    n-1 records (pairs) represented in the gene_orthologs file.

    ortholog gene groups are calculated by ncbi's eukaryotic genome
    annotation pipeline for the ncbi gene dataset using a combination
    of protein sequence similarity and local synteny information.
    orthologous gene relationships may additionally be assigned after
    manual review by a refseq genome curator. orthology is determined
    between a genome being annotated and a reference genome, typically
    human, and the set of pairwise orthologs are tracked as a group.

    for fish other than zebrafish, orthologs are computed in a
    two-layer process. 1:1 orthologs are computed vs zebrafish, and
    zebrafish orthologs are computed vs human. if the fish gene has a
    zebrafish ortholog that has a human ortholog, then the fish gene
    is combined into the human ortholog group and reported vs the human
    gene. otherwise it is reported vs the zebrafish gene. to determine
    all fish:zebrafish orthologs for a given tax_id, join the data to
    find the fish:human:zebrafish and fish:zebrafish data.
