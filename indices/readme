  these indices are based on a shared set of annotations and genomes. their
  sequence name conventions are adopted from 10x cell ranger.

  the sequences are downloaded and processed with a cellranger preprocess pipeline
  and downloaded from <http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-109/fasta/*>
  ensembl database. and the chromosome names are generally renamed to those
  starting with 'chr' (original ensembl fastas have just names with pure numbers)
  mitochondrial genome is named as chrM.

  annotation files (gtf) are downloaded from gencode annotations:
  <http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/>, modified with cellranger format
  and filtered to only contain a certain biotypes:

    * protein_coding
    * protein_coding_LoF
    * lncRNA
    * IG_C_gene
    * IG_D_gene
    * IG_J_gene
    * IG_LV_gene
    * IG_V_gene
    * IG_V_pseudogene
    * IG_J_pseudogene
    * IG_C_pseudogene
    * TR_C_gene
    * TR_D_gene
    * TR_J_gene
    * TR_V_gene
    * TR_V_pseudogene
    * TR_J_pseudogene

  such pre-formatted files are linked under the shared directory, for build with
  other non-cellranger pipelines.

  the corresponding full version of the annotation is stored in gencode/taxid
  folder, and coding gene is filtered out to generate a table and .rds file for
  easy access of genomic coding features.

  we also have tables for other annotation sources. gencode annotation make use
  of ensembl gene index, and there is also an ensembl's official one, having fewer
  features than this. ncbi refseq provides another set of annotation files,
  stored in refseq/taxid folder, and have distinct metadata syntax other than
  ensembl/gencode gffs. and these two versions of annotation do have some annotating
  differences. for more compatibility with cellranger based data, we recommend
  using the same annotation when processing droplet based single cell transcriptomics.
